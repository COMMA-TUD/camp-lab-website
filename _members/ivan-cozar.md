Dr. Ivan Ruiz is a postdoctoral researcher in the Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies group at TU Delft. During his PhD, he developed constitutive models to predict the plastic deformation and fracture of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) under dynamic loading conditions at the meso-scale level. Additionally, he has experience in the mechanical characterization of FRPs. Moreover, he has participated in various European projects and projects co-financed by the aeronautic industry. Within these projects, he conducted statistical analyses to identify the most significant input model parameters for the prediction of the quantity of interest from numerical models. Moreover, he carried out uncertainty quantification and management analyses to estimate the uncertainty of the quantity of interest.
